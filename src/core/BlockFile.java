/** BlockFile
  * Manages a random access file that can only be read and written to as
  *  fixed size blocks of bytes.
  * Java hides the details of reading and writing blocks from files, giving the
  *  illusion that a file is just a sequence of bytes. This is generally good
  *  because it makes Java more platform and OS independent.
  *  For efficiency that takes advantage of platform details, it would be more
  *  appropriate to use a language like C.
  * This class provides a file that wraps a standard RandomAccessFile in a way
  *  that requires the bytes to be read and written in fixed block sizes.
  *  simulating what might be provided by a low-level language.
